# TopicTrail Tink üåü

An interactive knowledge exploration tool built during the 2-hour AI Tinkerers Hackathon. TopicTrail helps users visualize and explore complex topics through an interactive graph interface, providing summaries and academic sources for deeper understanding.

## Features üöÄ

- **Interactive Knowledge Graph**: Start with any topic and see it branch into key concepts
- **Dynamic Exploration**: Three main actions for any selected node:
  - üìù **Summarize**: Get a detailed overview of the concept
  - üîç **Deep Dive**: Access a concise 50-word summary and relevant academic papers
  - üå≥ **Expand**: Discover related subtopics and continue exploring

- **Academic Integration**: Automatically fetches relevant papers from Semantic Scholar API
- **Context-Aware**: Maintains topic context throughout the exploration chain
- **Beautiful UI**: Clean, modern interface with a star-field animation background

## Tech Stack üíª

- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- Backend: FastAPI, Python
- APIs: OpenAI GPT-4, Semantic Scholar
- Database: Supabase
- Styling: Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started üèÅ

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aym183/topictrail_tink.git
cd topictrail_tink
```

2. Set up environment variables
```bash
# Create .env file and add your API keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
SUPABASE_URL=your_url_here
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key_here
```

3. Run the backend
```bash
make install
make run
```

3. Run the frontend
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How It Works üîÑ

1. Enter any topic you want to learn about
2. The app generates a knowledge graph with key aspects of the topic
3. Click on any node to:
   - Get a comprehensive summary
   - Access academic sources and a quick overview
   - Expand into subtopics for deeper exploration
4. Continue exploring through the knowledge tree!
